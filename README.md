Hi internet person,

My interests are provable security, e-voting, end-to-end encrypted messaging,
and metadata-free communications. Here are some projects of mine.

- Sirona: A tool for the Belenios e-voting system
  ([source](https://github.com/mjal/sirona))
  ([web-ui](https://mjal.github.io/sirona))

- Scrutin: An e2e verifiable e-voting app based on Belenios
  ([website](https://scrutin.app)) ([source](https://github.com/mjal/scrutin))

- [Random writings (The Safebook utopia)](https://blog.safebook.fr/)
